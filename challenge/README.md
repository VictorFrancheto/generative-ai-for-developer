# 🥳 Welcome to the team, new Generative AI Engineer!

You've joined a new AI startup focused on building **Reasoning Engines**. While our foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) are incredibly fluent and creative, we've hit a common but critical problem: they struggle with precise, procedural reasoning.

Ask an LLM to write a poem, and it excels. Ask it to count the number of 'e's in the word "effectiveness," and it will often fail, even while confidently giving a wrong answer. This "reasoning gap" is a major hurdle to building truly intelligent and reliable systems.

Your first project is to tackle this problem head-on.

## 🔥 The Challenge
Your challenge is to teach an instruction-tuned LLM to perform perfect, step-by-step reasoning for a specific task: counting the occurrences of a letter in a word.
This task is deceptively difficult for an LLM. It can't "see" the word all at once as we do. It must be taught to break the problem down, just as a person would:

**🧩 Spell the word letter by letter.**

- Spell the word letter by letter;
- At each letter, check if it's the one we're looking for;
- Keep a running total;
- State the final count.

You will use an advanced reinforcement learning (RL) method called Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to teach the model this behavior.

## 🚀 Your Product
Your final product will be a fine-tuned **Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct** model that demonstrates reliable step-by-step reasoning for the letter-counting task.

Because fine-tuning a 3-billion-parameter model is computationally expensive, you'll be using **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation). This means your "product" won't be a whole new 3B model, but rather a small, efficient "adapter" file (adapter_model.safetensors). This adapter plugs into the base model and imparts the new reasoning skill without altering the model's original knowledge.

## ✅ Deliverables
To complete this project, you will need to submit your fully completed **project/starter/gen_ai_fundamentals_project_starter.ipynb** notebook.

**This notebook should:**

- Have all TODO sections completed.
Include your explanations for hyperparameter choices (like lora_rank and target_modules);
- Contain the complete, functional code for all reward functions;
- Show the output of all training and evaluation cells.
