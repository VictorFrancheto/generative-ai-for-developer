    "# 🧠 Merge Sort with LLM — Hands-on Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will collaborate with an LLM to design and implement the merge sort algorithm and its corresponding tests. You'll practice writing effective prompts, validating the LLM's output, and reflecting on the quality of both the generated code and tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic understanding of Python programming (functions, lists).  \n",
    "- Familiarity with the concept of the merge sort algorithm.  \n",
    "- Experience with prompting Large Language Models (LLMs).  \n",
    "- Basic knowledge of the `unittest` framework in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Step 1 — Update the Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourth code cell, update the `USER_PROMPT` variable. Your prompt should ask the LLM to write a Python function named `merge_sort` that implements the merge sort algorithm, takes a list of integers, returns a new sorted list, and includes comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ▶️ Step 2 — Generate and Copy the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the cell to get the LLM's response, copy the generated `merge_sort` function.  \n",
    "In the sixth code cell, paste this function into the designated area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Step 3 — Update Expected Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the eighth code cell, update the `expected_A` and `expected_B` variables to contain the correctly sorted versions of the input lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `expected_A` should be `[5, 7, 16, 23, 42, 91]`.  \n",
    "- `expected_B` should be `[-4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5]`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Step 4 — Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tenth code cell, answer the four reflection questions about the generated `merge_sort` function by filling in the commented-out sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Step 5 — Final Reflection Comment\n",
    "\n",
    "In the twelfth code cell, add the final reflection comment:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The edge cases are handled correctly as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Step 6 — Generate Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fourteenth code cell, update the `USER_PROMPT` again. This time, ask the LLM to generate test cases for the `merge_sort` function using Python's `unittest` framework. The prompt should specify that the tests cover basic functionality, edge cases, and invalid inputs, all within a class named `TestMergeSort`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting the test cases from the LLM, copy the `TestMergeSort` class.  \n",
    "In the seventeenth code cell, paste the entire class into the designated area.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Step 7 — Adjust a Test Case\n",
    "\n",
    "In the test code you just pasted, locate the `test_invalid_string_input_raises_typeerror` method. Modify the call inside this method to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "merge_sort([\"c\", \"b\", \"a\"])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
