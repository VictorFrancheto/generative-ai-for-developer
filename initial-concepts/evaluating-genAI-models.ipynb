    "For **complex and subjective** tasks (creativity, helpfulness, tone), we can leverage another powerful LLM to act as an evaluator. The judge LLM receives the prediction, reference answer, and a detailed rubric to provide scored feedback.\n",
    "\n",

    "- ✅ Creative writing evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Subjective quality assessment\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-criteria evaluation\n",
    "- ✅ Tasks without clear right/wrong answers\n",
    "- ✅ Nuanced scoring requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "1. Define a clear evaluation rubric\n",
    "2. Provide the judge with: prediction, reference, and rubric\n",
    "3. Judge returns a score with reasoning\n",
    "4. Can scale to multiple criteria and complex scoring\n",
