        "\n",
        "## 🚀 Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Foundation models enable a wide range of intelligent applications without requiring task-specific training.  \n",
        "In this project, you will build a **spam classifier using only prompt engineering**, leveraging the model’s language understanding and reasoning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective is to classify SMS messages as **SPAM** or **NOT SPAM** while enforcing a structured **JSON output**, making the results easy to parse and integrate into downstream applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧭 Step-by-Step Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧩 Step 1 — Define the Task and Output Format  \n",
        "- Create a **SYSTEM_PROMPT** that clearly specifies:\n",
        "  - 🤖 The model’s role  \n",
        "  - 🎯 The classification task  \n",
        "  - 📦 The required JSON output structure  \n",
        "- This ensures consistent and machine-readable responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎬 Step 2 — Zero-Shot Classification  \n",
        "- Start with **instructions only**, without examples.  \n",
        "- Evaluate how well the model performs based solely on its prior knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📘 Step 3 — Few-Shot Enhancement  \n",
        "- Add a small set of **labeled examples** to the prompt.  \n",
        "- Use these in-context demonstrations to improve prediction consistency and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📱 Step 4 — Apply to Spam Detection  \n",
        "- Use the prompt structure to classify SMS messages as **SPAM** or **NOT SPAM**.  \n",
        "- Validate the JSON output and analyze prediction quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Step 5 — Iterate and Improve  \n",
        "- Refine prompt wording and constraints.  \n",
        "- Experiment with different example selections.  \n",
        "- Compare zero-shot and few-shot performance.  \n",
        "- Identify edge cases and limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✅ Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "- 🛠️ Well-designed prompts can transform foundation models into practical classifiers.  \n",
        "- ⚡ Zero-shot prompting is fast and simple but may lack precision.  \n",
        "- 🎯 Few-shot prompting often improves reliability but does not eliminate ambiguity.  \n",
        "- 🔁 The same prompting pattern can be adapted to many classification tasks beyond spam detection.\n"
